# static_malware_analysis
This repository houses the Python source code of static malware analysis using supervised-learning machine algorithms.

# Aim
*(1) To find the best suitable supervised machine learning algorithm that can increase the accuracy of malware detection
using machine learning.*

*(2) To reveal that using machine learning for the detection of malwares or threats is much more efficient than signature-based detection.*

*(3) To find out how efficiently and accurately supervised learning algorithm can detect malware on a system.*

# Software
The supervised machine learning model for this program was built and tested on a 64-bit Windows 10 Pro system. On it was 
installed Python, and Anaconda. The Python source codes for the 5 proposed supervised machine learning algorithms 
were properly done on Jupyter Notebook which was installed along side with Anaconda.

# Sanity Check of Datasets
For the sake of accurate predictions, the dataset obtained from kaggle needs to be checked for null values. These null 
values can make the model give wrong predictions.
